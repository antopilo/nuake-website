# Always face forward üß≠
If you're a fan of `Doom` or `Duke nukem`, then you'll be happy to hear that Sprites and billboards are now
supported in Nuake. If you prefer the older look for you games instead of having everything in 3D, then this is for you!

In case you are unaware of these terms, sprites are simply a 2D plane with a texture on them and billboarding is when they always face the camera.

They're pretty barebone for now but they support alpha cutout and you can optionally lock them on the X axis(pitch). I simply reused the billboarding logic from the particle system.

# What's missing? ‚ùì
The reason I said the current implememention is barebone is because they currently do not go through the generic material pipeline. That means that you won't be able to adjust the different
properties like roughness, metalness, AO, etc. It is planned though!

Another missing feature that I need to sit down and think about is shadows. I'm not sure how I want to make the shadow behave.
It could be quite jarring to see if the shadows of the billboarded sprites would be moving around as your move your camera.
I also want a way to disable them for some sprites(could be useful for decals for example).

# What can I do with them?
You can do basically anything you want with them! You could place them around the terrain with a grass texture and you'll end up with a cute grass patch. You could even use them for props around your scene, or monsters.
They're still used quite a lot to this day in modern games for far away trees or objects.

# How do I use them? üôÇ
The new `Sprite` can be added like any other component by selected the entity and clicking `Add component` and selecting `Sprite`.
You can then navigate with the file browser to your desired texture and drag and drop the image to the `Sprite` property.
You can then toggle the billboard behaviour in the component's properties.
