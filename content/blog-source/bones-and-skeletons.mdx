# Now comes your daily dose of calciumðŸ¥›
Bones and skeletons are now part of Nuake. That means that you can import your rigged models and
your skeleton should be visible in the editor. It is currently recommended to use `gltf` files for your 3D assets but `fbx` is also supported.
They also come along the new 2D gizmo system that showcases some icons from blendicons.

# How do I use it?
A new "Skinned Model" component now appears in the `Add Component` menu which will add this new component.
You can then drag & drop your asset file(`gltf` or `fbx`) and a skeleton hierarchy should be created in your scene as a child of the current entity.

> You should only use assets which have an actual rig because the import pipeline is different than regular 3D models.

# Some improvements
There is still a lot to improve with the current system, which is already in the backlog and will need to be done soon.
The major one is animation blending, meaning we need to blend between different animation clips when changing between different animation.
The ability to set if some animations are looping are not through the editor is also missing and the overall workflow is pretty barebone(pun not intended).

I also want to support vertex animations later on, but it's not something that I'm going to do until alpha.
